# What are the seven basics of coding?

1. Variables
2. Math & Logic
3. Input/Output
4. Conditions
5. Loops
6. Functions
7. Sequences & Data Structures

These 7 concepts can be combined in infinitely many ways. Once mastered, you can implement any program that's ever been written, in any programming language. 


## Defining the seven basics

Variables: Storage locations in code that hold data which can be changed during program execution. They are named so programmers can easily identify and manipulate their values.

Math & Logic: The mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (like AND, OR, NOT) that allow manipulation of variables and control the flow of the program based on conditions.

Input/Output: The mechanism by which a program receives data from the outside world (input), processes it, and then sends data back to the outside world (output). Examples include reading user input from a keyboard and displaying messages on a screen.

Conditions: Statements in code that execute different actions based on whether a specified condition is true or false. They are fundamental for decision-making in programming.

Loops: Constructs that repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met. They are used to automate repetitive tasks.

Functions: Named blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take inputs, process them, and return a result. They help in making code reusable and organized.

Sequences & Data Structures: Organized collections of data that can be manipulated efficiently. Sequences refer to ordered collections where each item has a specific position, while data structures are more complex organizations of data for efficient access and modification (e.g., arrays, lists, trees, and graphs).



# You can have any genius zone

Rails is a platform that runs Ruby (a language) that can run on websites, and it runs 4 million websites.

The creator was an English major, and he approached it like English. 

Mozart created great music, but we can love other musicians. 

# Start learning the seven basics with python

## Introduction to concepts of syntax

```{python}
print("Hello!")

```

Print: Function Name

Parenthesis: Function Parameters

Text is in quotes "" and ''

Output: Hello!

```{python}
print("Challenge #", 2 + 3 )

# "Challenge # <- First Parameter
# , seperator
# 2 + 3 <- Second Parameter

```

# Variables

## Assignment statement

x = 4

Officially called left hand side (lhs) and right hand side (rhs).

lhs = rhs

This is telling you what x is, not asking you "is x equal to 4?" that would be a different syntax. In Python, this is two equal signs ==.

## Alternate vocabulary

Variable Declaration
Variable Definition
Variable Initialization

Variable Name | Variable Value
x             |  4

## Examples of variables

x = 4
y = 2 + 3
z = x + y
x = 0
z + = 1
If z=9, then the result would be 10 (z = z + 1)


```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
import turtle

turtle.color("red")
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.right(120)
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.right(120)
turtle.forward(50)


```





```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
import turtle

turtle.color("red")
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(50)

```




```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

import turtle
# side = 50
side = 100
turtle.color("red")
turtle.forward(side)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(side)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(side)

```


### Use variables to make your codes "dry"

```{python}
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)





```

# Loop Variables
for <loop variable> in <sequence>: #Do the repeated code

(start,stop, step)


```{python}
for i in range(1,11)

print(i)
```



```{python}
for char in "hello"
print(char)

```



```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
import turtle
# side = 50
side = 100
turtle.color("red")
turtle.forward(side)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(side)
turtle.left(120)
turtle.forward(side)
```

You can have a variable "i" without using it, because the loop will still run the following code.

```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
import turtle

turtle.color("red")
side = 100

for i in range(3):
  turtle.forward(side)
  turtle.left(120)
  
```


```{python eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

import turtle

turtle.color("red")
side = 100

for i in range(3):
  turtle.forward(side)
  turtle.left(120)

turtle.color("blue")
side = 50

for i in range(3):
  turtle.forward(side)
  turtle.left(120)
  
  
```
